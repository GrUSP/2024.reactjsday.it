        talk_description: "In this talk, we explore the application of React Server Components (RSC) to elevate the functionality and efficiency of forms. 
        <br />We will touch upon the core principles of RSC and their specific benefits for form development, such as improved load times and streamlined server-side processing.
        <br /> Additionally, we’ll learn the latest advancements in React 19 and the introduction of multiple new hooks. <br /> <br />
        Attendees will gain insights into practical strategies for integrating RSC into forms, focusing on enhancing user experience and reducing front-end complexities."

        talk_title: "Do Frontend Devs dream of Backend functions?"
        talk_description: "When the concepts of SSR, SSG, and Hydration seemed well-established and standard, new frameworks bring us an increasingly full-stack view of frontend development and communication with the backend. <br />
        <br />
        In this talk, using the innovations of React 19 and Next 14 as a narrative device, we will embark on a journey to discover new rendering techniques, performance improvements, and a new perspective on communication with the backend. 
        <br />This will help us choose the next framework with a clear understanding of what we need (and don’t need)!"

        talk_description: "If you are familiar with accessibility in HTML and CSS, then you are good to go in a React application as well. 
        <br />Most of the rules still apply, but you may need to write it a little differently, and consider other things in addition, which we will discuss in more detail in this talk."
