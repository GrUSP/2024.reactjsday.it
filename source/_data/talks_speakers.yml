        <br />We will touch upon the core principles of RSC and their specific benefits for form development, such as improved load times and streamlined server-side processing.
        <br /> Additionally, weâ€™ll learn the latest advancements in React 19 and the introduction of multiple new hooks. <br /> <br />
        Attendees will gain insights into practical strategies for integrating RSC into forms, focusing on enhancing user experience and reducing front-end complexities."
