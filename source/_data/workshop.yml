        teacher_bio: "Product designer, remote worker, agile enthusiast, and passionate about design. I am a Senior Growth Product Designer @ YAZIO and a startup mentor at the Contamination Lab in Faenza. I grew up around industrial design and software development. I keep solutions simple, scalable, and accessible in design, code, and strategy. Daily, you can find me in co-working spaces taking care of YAZIO's monetization and design system at Contamination Lab or some DIY concert in Romagna. I have loved design systems since then, especially after the release of Alla Kholmatova's book, with whom I had the opportunity and fortune to work on the first workshop held in Italy on design systems (Bologna, 2018)."
