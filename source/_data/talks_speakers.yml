        <br />Depending on the needs of a company and its products, however, it may be necessary to scale it to other platforms such as iOS and Android, while still maintaining consistency across all of them. 
        <br />How can a design system scale across multiple platforms while keeping the codebase easy to manage? What should the entire tech-stack look like to support this? And most importantly, how can the user experience be consistent despite each platform having different standard components? 
        <br /> <br /> We will show how we answered to these questions by presenting Ritmo, the Musixmatch’s cross-platform design system we developed in React Native."

        <br />Most of the rules still apply, but you may need to write it a little differently, and consider other things in addition, which we will discuss in more detail in this talk."

        talk_description: "Have you ever built a side project or thought about building your own startup?
          <br /><br />
          One of the most important things is fast and secure development. And here comes Firebase in combination with React into the game. I will explain how Firebase + React allows me to run a software company at the age of 17 by myself and how you can leverage the tools provided by Firebase to have a better developer experience, more secure react apps, and faster results.
          <br /><br />
          All principles and technologies you will learn about in this talk can be applied immediately in your side projects!"

        talk_title: "The magic behind the React compiler"
        talk_description: "Every React developer is used to dealing with its render mechanism, trying to avoid unnecessary re-rendering using memoization techniques like useMemo and useCallback. But this will be a thing of the past thanks to the React compiler, a brand-new build tool that optimizes our app for us. 
        <br /> <br />
        In this talk, we will take a deep dive into how the React compiler works under the hood and how it will enhances our code cache management in many different ways."
